exploitation, and neglect through law, policy, and practice in a human
rights framework.@@latex:}@@

Across the world, children are at risk from violence, abuse,
exploitation, and neglect. Conflict and natural disasters have forced
millions to flee their homes and confront the dangers of migration and
displacement. Commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking, child
labor, and child marriage are problems in many countries. At-risk
children and adolescents need their rights enforced if we are to
protect them from harm and to ensure that they develop to their full
potential.

Led by Jacqueline Bhabha, Research Director of the Harvard FXB Center
for Health and Human Rights, this course will teach you the causes and
consequences of child protection failures. You will consider the
strategies, international laws, standards, and resources required to
protect all children. You will be able to link legal frameworks and
child-rights approaches to the work of policymakers, lawyers, health
workers, educators, law enforcement, and social workers. Learners will
come to understand how they can ensure the protection of children and
apply child protection strategies to their own work.

Join Harvard faculty, practitioners, and a global community of
learners to master a child-centered systems approach to preventing and
responding to violence, exploitation, and abuse against children.

*** A welcome letter from the instructor:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Dear Learner:

  Welcome to Child Protection: /Children's Rights in Theory and
  Practice/, a course about how to protect children from violence,
  exploitation, and neglect through law, policy, and practice in a
  human rights framework.

  \index{Harvard X}
  \index{Harvard FXB Center for Health and Human Rights}
  This course was developed by Harvard X and the Harvard FXB Center
  for Health and Human Rights.  The course is informed by the belief
  that training and education on child rights and protection are
  important in understanding how ---and why --- children experience
  \index{violence!experienced by children}
  violence, and in acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to
  prevent or address these harms. We hope this course will be useful
  to students and professionals from a range of disciplines and
  countries, enabling those who follow the course to understand the
  broad scope of protection risks children face. The course covers a
  range of child protection threats (including child labor, child
  marriage, trafficking, abuse, neglect) and it presents a range of
  perspectives on how to respond to the needs of children, and how to
  create environments, institutions, laws and policies which protect
  children from harm.
